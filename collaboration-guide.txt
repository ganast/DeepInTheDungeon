Claiming tasks

Each one of the following list of tasks can be assigned to one person only. To claim a task fill-in your name and surname in the respective field. This will allow you to test collaborative development on the same file via a remote repository. Also, it will allow you to test conflict resolution (since there are more people than tasks, at least one conflict is certain to happen (to find out more, read about the pigeonhole principle)).
